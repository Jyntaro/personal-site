This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## About

This is a personal website I built using React, Typescript, and Next.js along with a few nice libraries like Material UI and typewriter-effect.

I considered making this website using Vite, but ultimately settled with Next.js since it has so much nice functionality out of the box, and it was ultimately a good decision because I ended up using a lot of the built in functions and components like `<Link />` and `usePathname()` nav function to get the current path with little code clutter. It also gave the project a natural file structure with Next.js 13's new organizational page structure and made spinning up new pages and routing seamless. It also came with a bunch of initial setup and useful packages that reduced overhead when building this site.
