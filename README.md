This is a small project focused on learning new frontend frameworks like Next.js.

## About

This site is built using React, Typescript, and Next.js along with a few nice libraries like Material UI and typewriter-effect.

I considered making this website using Vite, but ultimately settled with Next.js since it has great functionality out of the box, and it was ultimately a good decision as I liberally used its built-in components and functions such as `<Link />` and `usePathname()` since they were often easier to use and cleaner than the alternatives. Next.js 13's new page structure using folders made routing and organization seamless. Finally, the initial setup added useful packages and settings that reduced overhead getting off the ground when building this site.

Ultimately, design is the most challenging part of building a personal website. There are so many great variations out there, and it's difficult to make a site that is uniquely mine and also looks and feels good. Hopefully I've managed both of these through a unique color scheme and a mix of animations.

## Fun Extras

I added some fun animations and button hover effects using gsap, which comes with more powerful tooling and better code design than the standard React Animation library.

I also used media queries and viewport percentages to make the site resizable and mobile friendly.

Homepage was inspired by Rahul Vijay's [personal site](https://rahulvijay-portfolio.netlify.app/).
