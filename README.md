This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## About

This is a personal website I built using React, Typescript, and Next.js along with a few nice libraries like Material UI and typewriter-effect.

I considered making this website using Vite, but ultimately settled with Next.js since it has great functionality out of the box, and it was ultimately a good decision because I ended up liberally using its built-in components and functions such as `<Link />` and `usePathname()` since they were often easier to use and cleaner than the alternatives. It also gave the project a natural file structure with Next.js 13's new organizational page structure which made spinning up new pages and routing seamless. Finally, the initial setup installed useful packages and settings that reduced overhead getting off the ground when building this site.
